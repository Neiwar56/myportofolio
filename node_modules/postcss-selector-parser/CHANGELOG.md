# 5.0.0-rc.1

To ease adoption of the v5.0 release, we have relaxed the node version
check performed by npm at installation time to allow for node 4, which
remains officially unsupported, but likely to continue working for the
time being.

# 5.0.0-rc.0

This release has **BREAKING CHANGES** that were required to fix regressions
in 4.0.0 and to make the Combinator Node API consistent for all combinator
types. Please read carefully.

## Summary of Changes

* The way a descendent combinator that isn't a single space character (E.g. `.a  .b`) is stored in the AST has changed.
* Named Combinators (E.g. `.a /for/ .b`) are now properly parsed as a combinator.
* It is now possible to look up a node based on the source location of a character in that node and to query nodes if they contain some character.
* Several bug fixes that caused the parser to hang and run out of memory when a `/` was encountered have been fixed.
* The minimum supported version of Node is now `v6.0.0`.

### Changes to the Descendent Combinator

In prior releases, the value of a descendant combinator with multiple spaces included all the spaces.

* `.a   .b`: Extra spaces are now stored as space before.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `combinator.value === "   "`
  - New hotness:
    - `combinator.value === " " && combinator.spaces.before === "  "`
* `.a   /*comment*/.b`: A comment at the end of the combinator causes extra space to become after space.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `combinator.value === "   "`
    - `combinator.raws.value === "   /*comment/"`
  - New hotness:
    - `combinator.value === " "`
    - `combinator.spaces.after === "  "`
    - `combinator.raws.spaces.after === "  /*comment*/"`
* `.a<newline>.b`: whitespace that doesn't start or end with a single space character is stored as a raw value.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `combinator.value === "\n"`
    - `combinator.raws.value === undefined`
  - New hotness:
    - `combinator.value === " "`
    - `combinator.raws.value === "\n"`

### Support for "Named Combinators"

Although, nonstandard and unlikely to ever become a standard, combinators like `/deep/` and `/for/` are now properly supported.

Because they've been taken off the standardization track, there is no spec-official name for combinators of the form `/<ident>/`. However, I talked to [Tab Atkins](https://twitter.com/taba
